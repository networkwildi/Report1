This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Part 1
# Load the data and answer the following questions:
students <- read_csv("students.csv")                                           # read the file

student_clean <- clean_names(students) %>%                                     # clean names
  select(question = x1,everything()) %>%                                       # rename x1
 mutate(total_answers = totally_disagree + disagree +  agree + totally_agree ) # summarise row


# What is the total number of answers obtained from students? 

student_clean %>% 
  summarise(answers_all = sum(total_answers))                   # summarise the total of all answers

```
Total number of answers obtained from students

```{r}

professors <- read_csv("professors.csv")

professors_clean <- clean_names(professors) %>% 
select(question = x1,everything()) %>%                                       # rename x1
 mutate(total_answers = totally_disagree + disagree +  agree + totally_agree ) # summarise row

```
What is the total number of answers obtained from professors?
```{r}
professors_clean %>% 
    summarise("Total anwers of all professors" = sum(total_answers))

```


```{r}

# glimpse(student_clean)
# glimpse(professors_clean)


student_clean %>%
pull(total_answers) %>%
unique

```
Does each question have the same number of answers?
```{r}

professors_clean %>% 
  pull(total_answers) %>% 
  unique()


```
Does each question have the same number of answers?

Part 2
Obtain side-by-side bar charts comparing the distribution of answers of the students versus the professors for each question.
```{r}






```

Part 3
With Likert scale data, we cannot use the mean as a measure of central tendency as it has no meaning (i.e. what is the average of strongly agree and disagree?).

The most appropriate measure of central tendency is the mode. Compute the mode for the students and professors for each of the questions


```{r}




```
