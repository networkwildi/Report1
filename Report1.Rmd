This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Part 1
# Load the data and answer the following questions:

students <- read_csv("students.csv")
# View(students)
student_clean <- clean_names(students)
view(student_clean)

# What is the total number of answers obtained from students? 
names(student_clean)

student_clean %>% 
  mutate(total_answers = totally_disagree + disagree +  agree + totally_agree ) %>% 
  summarise(answers_all = sum(total_answers))

```
Total number of answers obtained from students

```{r}

professors <- read_csv("professors.csv")
professors_clean <- clean_names(professors)
view(professors_clean)
glimpse(student_clean)
glimpse(professors_clean)
names(professors_clean)

professors_clean %>% 
mutate(total_answers_pros = totally_disagree + disagree + agree + totally_agree) %>% 
    summarise(answer_all_pros = sum(total_answers_pros))

```
What is the total number of answers obtained from professors?


# Does each question have the same number of answers?
