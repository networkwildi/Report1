This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# 06. Report 4

Introduction
This project is more challenging on the data extraction side. You are going to get your dataset from a website (a fake rental agency). The goal is to practice your scraping skills with {rvest} and end up with a clean tibble that you can use for analysis.


The data
The data doesn't come to you as a dataset, it comes to you as a website.

https://epfl-exts.github.io/rental-scrape/

Your first challenge is to write the code needed to scrape the data contained in it. To help you see what the end goal is, you can find a sample extract of the final dataset in the Resources tab (only 5 rows).

### Exercises

Part 1
Get the full dataset out of the site. Your code should end up with a tibble of a bit more than 600 rows and 9 columns. Make sure you take the time to convert each columns to the right type and not all character.

```{r}
# not solved yet

```

Part 2
Create a scatterplot showing how price evolves with living space of the flat.

```{r}
# not solved yet

```

Part 3
Create a bar plot showing the number of properties by postcode. Is this agency more "active" in certain areas?

```{r}
# not solved yet

```


Part 4
Create a more complex scatterplot, showing how price evolves with living space of the flat by postcode and by floor. You can use colors and/or facets to make the categories visible.


Can you conclude anything from it? Put your thoughts below your plot. Don't overthink this: this is not so much about the quality of your analysis than checking that you can put a report together. For example, integrate the most expensive and least expensive mean postcode/floor combo in your text with inline code.

```{r}
# not solved yet

```


Part 5
Can you see any trends for listings with addresses only available on demand? Are they more expansive or less? Bigger living space? Higher floor? Keep in mind that boxplot/violin plots work really well to compare distributions of values between groups!

```{r}

# not solved yet

```

Part 6
Convert a subset of 30 addresses to latitude and longitude using an API and plot them on a map using {ggmap} (or {leaflet} if you could not get {ggmap} to work).

```{r}

# not solved yet

```
